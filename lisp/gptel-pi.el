;;; Commentary:

;; gptel-pi is a small, Org-native coding-agent harness built on top of gptel.
;; It supplies a coding system prompt, a handful of local tools, bounded tool
;; use, durable in-buffer tool receipts, explicit transcript compaction, and
;; advisory context accounting.  gptel still owns requests, streaming, tool
;; dispatch, response properties, persistence, and rewrite review.
;;
;; Design principles
;; -----------------
;;
;; The conversation buffer is the source of truth.  Conversation history,
;; archived output, compaction checkpoints, links, and branches are ordinary
;; editable Org text.  This library deliberately does not provide a dashboard,
;; command palette, custom agent loop, automatic retry, automatic compaction,
;; or a second acceptance UI.  In particular, it does not advise
;; `gptel-send'.  It uses gptel's public request and tool hooks and composes
;; with the normal `gptel-rewrite' workflow.
;;
;; User-created Org headings define conversation branches.  Model-created
;; headings do not: after each completed response,
;; `gptel-pi-normalize-assistant-headings' changes assistant headings such as
;; "** Findings" into presentational labels such as "*Findings*".  It leaves
;; user text and headings inside source, example, quote, reasoning, and tool
;; blocks alone.
;;
;; Starting and using a session
;; ----------------------------
;;
;; Run `gptel-pi' in a project.  It reuses the most recently visited gptel-pi
;; session for the current project root.  With C-u it creates another session;
;; with C-u C-u it prompts for an existing session.  The command uses
;; `project-current' when possible and otherwise uses `default-directory'.
;; Continue to send prompts with ordinary `gptel-send' and use the standard
;; gptel commands and menus for model, backend, tool, and request control.
;;
;; A new Org session has this shape:
;;
;;   * Archive
;;   ** Tool outputs
;;   ** Compactions
;;   * Conversation
;;   @user
;;
;; Point starts in Conversation.  `gptel-org-branching-context' is enabled
;; buffer-locally, so the Archive sibling is not replayed while point remains
;; in the active conversation lineage.  Following an archive link is ordinary
;; Org navigation; return to Conversation before sending another prompt unless
;; the archive itself is intentionally being used as context.
;;
;; Saved Org chats retain the gptel-pi preset through gptel's normal state
;; persistence.  When such a file is reopened and `gptel-mode' restores the
;; preset, gptel-pi reinstalls its buffer-local hooks and mode-line entries.
;;
;; Important commands
;; ------------------
;;
;; - `gptel-pi' starts, reuses, or selects a project session.
;; - `gptel-send' is the unchanged, standard way to send a prompt.
;; - `gptel-pi-archive-region' copies a selected transcript region verbatim to
;;   Archive/Compactions and leaves an ordinary link beside the source.
;; - `gptel-pi-compact-region' first performs that archival operation and then
;;   starts standard `gptel-rewrite' with tools disabled and a checkpoint
;;   directive.  Accept, reject, diff, ediff, merge, or iterate using gptel's
;;   normal rewrite actions.  Rejecting a rewrite intentionally leaves the
;;   visible archive snapshot and link, which can be removed by normal editing
;;   or undo.
;;
;; Tools and retained output
;; -------------------------
;;
;; The preset advertises five tools: `read', `bash', `eval', `write', and
;; `edit'.  Reads use one-indexed line offsets, independent line and UTF-8 byte
;; limits, head truncation, and actionable continuation offsets.  Bash uses a
;; pipe rather than a PTY, keeps the useful tail, separates stdout and stderr,
;; and reports exit, timeout, and signal status.  Eval is intended for relevant
;; live Emacs state, not general project exploration.  Edit rejects empty or
;; non-unique old text.  Write is intended for new files or complete rewrites.
;;
;; While Bash or eval is running, a purely visual tail overlay is shown at the
;; end of the session buffer.  Bash's stdout and stderr process buffers are
;; sampled periodically; the overlay is removed when the tool result arrives.
;; It never inserts transcript text or marks the conversation modified.  Eval
;; is synchronous, so it can show a waiting indicator but cannot expose
;; intermediate output before evaluation returns.
;;
;; Large read, Bash, and printed eval results are stored in Archive/Tool
;; outputs.  The active tool result contains a concise receipt and an ordinary
;; Org link to the complete output.  The archive is in the same buffer; no
;; temporary file is treated as durable history.  Text reads are the supported
;; read path at present; binary media should be attached through gptel's normal
;; media/context facilities rather than assumed to be available from a tool
;; result in the current turn.
;;
;; Tool calls are autonomous under the preset, so the user is assumed to be
;; comfortable allowing the advertised file and shell operations in the
;; current project.  gptel-pi stops a request through
;; `gptel-pre-tool-call-functions' after a hard budget, repeated identical
;; calls, or repeated identical failures.  It never restarts the request.  A
;; small "Pi tools N" mode-line item shows the current count and adds "!" near
;; or at a stop condition.
;;
;; If `agent-shell-command-prefix' is buffer-local and effective, Bash commands
;; are prefixed with it.  In that sandboxed situation the Emacs-hosted read,
;; write, edit, and eval tools are removed from the request because they would
;; bypass the shell sandbox.  Bash assumes `shell-file-name' accepts
;; `shell-command-switch'; positive timeouts additionally assume a compatible
;; external `timeout' executable.
;;
;; Project context and workflow assumptions
;; ----------------------------------------
;;
;; The harness assumes coding work is rooted at an Emacs project (or at least a
;; meaningful `default-directory'), that prompts and assistant replies remain
;; in the Org conversation, and that the user creates branches with normal Org
;; headings.  A root AGENTS.md, the local and home skill indexes, and nearby
;; subdirectory AGENTS.md paths are inserted as editable quote blocks under
;; the Conversation heading, so they remain part of the prompt and can be
;; changed directly in the buffer.
;;
;; Context pressure is advisory only.  "Pi ctx N%" estimates the active Org
;; lineage plus the system prompt, uses model context-window metadata when
;; present, and otherwise falls back to `gptel-pi-default-context-window' and
;; `gptel-pi-context-chars-per-token'.  One or two exclamation marks indicate
;; warning and critical thresholds.  The estimate never blocks or intercepts
;; a send, mutates history, invokes compaction, or retries an overflow.  Exact
;; provider token accounting is preferred conceptually, but the current
;; indicator is intentionally documented as an estimate.
